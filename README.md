# MSc-Project

This project was a part of my MSc. dissertation and used K-means clustering to investigate a protein called **FACT** in *Saccharomyces Cerrevisiae* (baker's yeast). The entire data analysis pipeline was coded in Python (version 3.9) and the IDE was Microsoft Visual Studio (v. 1.82). 

Some of the major results are shared below, and the full code will be made available in due course.
