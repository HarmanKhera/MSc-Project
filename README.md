# MSc-Project

This project was a part of my MSc. dissertation and uses K-means clustering to investigate a protein called FACT *Saccharomyces Cerrevisiae* (baker's yeast). The entire data analysis pipeline was built in Python (version 3.9) and the IDE was Microsoft Visual Studio (v. 1.82). 

Some of the major results are posted below, and the full code and dissertation text will be made available in due course.
